# NLP-lstm
Code and data used in my bachelors thesis

This directory contains most of the files used in my thesis, more specific instructions are inside the notebooks. All of the notebooks are made
with the assumption that it's being run out of the directory its currently in.

The data folder contains subfolders with the names of the corpera. These subfolders contain the model, the corpus and information about the corpus and model. Instructions about how to run the trained models are inside the notebook 'LSTM language model'.

The LSTM language model file containts the training procedure and data cleaning, as well as text generation.

The textdeter and textrandom are some larger generated texts you can look through, it can take quite a while to generate them yourself.

In the Compression Kolmogorov notebook you can compress the corpera.

The plots notebook contain most of the plots used in my thesis.

The typicality and other data gives a way to calculate the typicality and vocabulary size of a corpus
